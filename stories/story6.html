<h1>Embarking on My Japanese Content Adventure</h1>

<p>To start the journey, the reason why
    I started this Japanese Content
    Adventure is because I want to
    practice my Japanese skills. I want
    to apply what I learn in Japanese
    and this will serve as a steppingstone.</p>

<p>Actually, I don't have confidence
    to post my Japanese Content Journey
    publicly in Instagram, I rather do
    it privately because I am anxious
    about criticisms and there will be
    many people who will see me.</p>

<p>I might be shy but this will serve
    as a legacy for when I was in
    college. This memories will be
    stored like a time capsule when
    someone asks for my Instagram.</p>

<p>When that time comes, I wonder what
    will my future self reaction will be.
    Just thinking about it makes me grin
    at how ridiculous my thought is.
    I'm sure it will bring back
    memories of the past.</p>

<p>Well if you want to see my Instagram
    account, you can follow me and if
    I know you, you can see my Japanese
    Content Adventure.</p>
