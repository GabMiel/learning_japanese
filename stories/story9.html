<h1>Thinking About the People Who Might See My Work One Day</h1>

<p>Sometimes I think about the people
    who might see my work one day
    because it feels strange to imagine
    someone reading the things I write
    in the future. Maybe it will be
    a friend, a classmate, or a stranger.</p>

<p>I get shy about posting publicly
    because I worry about how people
    might judge me. But I still write
    because a part of me hopes someone
    will understand what I am trying
    to say someday.</p>

<p>They might see my mistakes because
    my writing is simple and honest.
    But that is fine because these
    stories show who I am right now
    and what I was thinking during
    my Japanese journey.</p>

<p>If someone reads this in the future,
    I hope they feel the sincerity
    because I wrote everything with
    honesty. I hope it reminds them
    of how I tried and how I kept
    going even when I was unsure.</p>

<p>And if no one reads it, that is fine
    because what matters is that I
    created something. I left something
    behind that shows I tried and that
    I cared about my journey at this
    moment in my life.</p>
