<h1>The Reason I Want to Share My Japanese Journey Online</h1>

<p>I want to share my Japanese journey
    online because it helps me stay
    motivated. I feel more responsible
    for my progress because I know
    I am documenting something that
    matters to me.</p>

<p>I also want to share it because
    I want to see how far I can go.
    When I look back one day, I want
    to remember the small steps I took
    and the moments that made me
    continue learning.</p>

<p>I get shy posting publicly because
    I worry about mistakes, but I still
    want to share my journey because
    it feels meaningful. It becomes
    a reminder that I tried and that
    I kept going.</p>

<p>I also share it because I hope
    someone out there might feel
    inspired to start their own
    learning journey. Even if only
    one person relates to it, that
    is already enough for me.</p>

<p>In the end, I share my Japanese
    journey online because it is
    part of who I am right now.
    It shows my effort, my growth,
    and my curiosity, and I want
    to remember all of it someday.</p>
