<h1>The Story Behind Creating My Japanaese Website</h1>

<p>I might not have a a story to tell since I
    create this website based on reasons
    on what I want. But hey! Even though I
    don't have story to share in this 1st
    story, I still want to thank you for
    reading this.</p>

<p> I want to create a fun website where I
    can share my aspirations. It might not
    be like other systems but I want it to
    be connected to the word "fun". As
    long as it's fun and you are learning in
    it, that would be best!</p>

<p>I want to leave a legacy of my journey,
    that I am also a person who have a
    story to share, one of many who
    dreams about their future, journey!!</p>

<p>I want to leave an impact, I don't want
    to blend in the background and
    become forgettable and ordinary, I
    want to leave something meaningful,
    a story worth sharing!</p>
