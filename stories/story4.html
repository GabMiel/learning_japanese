<h1>That Phase Where I Didn’t Know What to Do Next</h1>

<p>After learning Hiragana and getting
    used to Duolingo lessons, I reached
    this quiet point in my Japanese
    journey where I honestly didn’t know
    what to do next.</p>

<p>I struggled and wondered a lot on
    what to do next, because it felt
    like I was applying this knowledge
    for nothing. Even to this day
    I am struggling and juggling
    school work at the same time.</p>

<p>Time is really a precious thing
    but for me, it's constant overthinking
    of ideas of school work and what
    to do with my time. Thinking about
    the future is like hoping for
    a miracle. Also it would be better
    if it had meaning to it.</p>

<p>Thinking about long term goals
    is exhausting, but I constantly
    do the work every day, and that's
    what is important.</p>

<p>Even though I am watching anime
    and reading manhwa, I didn't try
    to understand the words, I am just
    watching and reading them for fun.
    Well, it's because it's fun.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find myself spacing out
    and just observing in silence.
    Doing nothing and just by being
    myself. I don't hate solitude,
    it just feels like I only care
    about myself.</p>

<p>I don't try having shallow conversations
    because I want depth. Shallow
    conversations are common, and it's
    always an open-ended question
    every day.</p>

<p>Selfish, loner, introvert, kind,
    respectful, giving smile to everyone
    when meeting someone even though
    I don't know their name, introspective
    when it comes to planning the day,
    yeah that's me.</p>

<p>But no matter what situation is happening,
    I'll still try to keep being myself
    and hoping one day I will finish
    the tasks that I am doing. It would
    be nice if someone can appreciate
    and read this.</p>
