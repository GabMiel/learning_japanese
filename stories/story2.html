<h1>How I First Got Interested in Japanese</h1>

<p>When I was a kid, I am already
    watching cartoons and anime in T.V,
    of course it's dub in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Growing up and now that I am a
    teenager, I first got hooked in
    watching anime, I started watching
    anime website online and my first
    anime that I watch online is "Detective
    Conan" and stop at around episode 1000.</p>

<p>After watching many different
    animes, I saw my uncle reading
    Manhwa, at that time I thought it was
    boring, but after months, I got
    influence and my curiosity got hooked
    so I try it.</p>

<p>My uncle intall an app called
    Tachiyomi in my phone and configure it,
    then he add a Manhwa called "Dice:
    The Cube That Changes Everything"
    it was a nice story, but I quitted
    halfway, lol.</p>

<p>After reading many manhwas, I delve
    into many different worlds and
    expand my horizon. My fantasy
    starting to connect to reality little by
    little. Until something pops up in my
    mind.</p>

<p>What if I started learning Japanese...
    It lingers in my mind for a long time,
    until I have a classmate who I just
    saw using Duolingo and he is learning
    Japanese just for fun. He influence
    me to try that too. That was Marx!</p>

<p>Then little by little, I started writing
    Hiragana in my notebook and some
    of my classmates saw me writing
    Japanese letters, it's embarrassing
    and kind of proud that someone
    notice what I am doing.</p>

<p>So yeah! as time goes by, I still play
    Duolingo and still trying to keep the
    momentum going. I also keep
    learning Japanese day by day and I
    hope I can meet Japanese people
    someday.
