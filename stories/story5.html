<h1>My First Japanese Music That I Transliterated</h1>

<p>This will be a short story. It started
    back then in 2015, I really love
    watching anime called "Sword Art
    Online" in TV from the Philippines.
    My family watch it in the morning
    when I was a kid.</p>

<p>Then in 2021, it gives me
    reminiscence when I watch it again
    through online using smartphone.
    I remember the song and it was
    the song that my uncle didn't want
    to skip because it was so good.</p>

<p>That song is called "Crossing Fields"
    by LiSA. I started transliterating
    or creating my custom lyrics
    because of this music because I
    want to memorize this song and
    I like the song a lot.</p>

<p>When I am transliterating this
    I am shocked because my surname
    really is called in the song.
    You can say that it was my
    signature song because it's the
    song with my name on it.</p>

<p>So yeah, this song is memorable
    to me because it's the first
    song I transliterated and it
    have my name on it. Thanks
    for reading I guess.</p>
