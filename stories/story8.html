<h1>How I Celebrate My Tiny Achievements in Learning</h1>

<p>For me, the only time that I only
    celebrated my tiny achievements
    in learning Japanese is when I
    complete my Japanese Content
    Adventure journey.</p>

<p>I celebrated it by eating Siopao
    or drinking milk tea with the
    flavor of Cookies and Cream.
    I also sometimes went to fast
    food chains like Jollibee, KFC,
    McDo and many more to eat food.</p>

<p>But I only went there because I
    have a purpose, it is to celebrate
    my achievements not because of
    money, I am actually very frugal
    about it. I only choose menu
    that are cheap and make me feel full.</p>

<p>Also, it serves as a memory that
    I explore different kinds of
    establishments and that I love
    exploring different kinds of foods.
    But Siopao and Milk tea are one
    of my favorite food on my lists.</p>
