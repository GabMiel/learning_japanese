<h1>The Moments That Reminded Me Why I Started</h1>

<p>There were times when I felt tired,
    when learning Japanese seemed too hard,
    and I wondered if I should stop.
    But then, small moments reminded me
    why I began this journey.</p>

<p>One moment was when a classmate
    noticed my notebook filled with Hiragana.
    They asked me about it,
    and I felt proud to share
    that I was learning Japanese.
    That simple recognition gave me strength.</p>

<p>Another moment was when I understood
    a word in anime without subtitles.
    It was just a small phrase,
    but it made me realize
    that my effort was paying off.
    I smiled, knowing I was improving.</p>

<p>There were also times when I wrote
    page after page of characters,
    and even though it felt repetitive,
    I remembered the joy of progress.
    Each notebook became proof
    that I was moving forward.</p>

<p>These moments reminded me
    that learning Japanese is not only about words,
    but about discipline, passion, and dreams.
    They brought me back to the reason
    I started in the first place —
    to connect, to grow, and to leave a story
    worth remembering.</p>
