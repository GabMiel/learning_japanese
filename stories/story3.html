<h1>My First Steps in Learning Japanese</h1>

<p>After being inspired by anime, manhwa,
    and my classmates, I finally decided
    to take my first real steps in learning
    Japanese. It wasn’t just a passing thought
    anymore, I wanted to see how far I could go.</p>

<p>I started with creating my own lines
    in the pages of my notebook like adding
    vertical lines because its just ordinary notebook
    not a math notebook where its already have its
    own square spaces. It took some time but it's
    worth it!</p>

<p> Then after that, I started with Hiragana
    characters. I started with the word "a"
    or in japanese, it's "あ".
    I was only fill with thought of
    finishing or completing the page of my
    notebook and I didn't care much about time.</p>

<p> After completing that, I felt a sense of
    relief and a little joy of accomplishment.
    Well, its fun, so I decided to write as
    much as possible. The challenges for me
    was creating vertical lines on each page so
    it's really a hassle but i keep going.</p>

<p>I also have this side of being a perfectionist
    when creating this vertical lines because I
    wanted each space to be perfect and measured
    with a ruler, so it really took me long like
    5 minutes per page, but in the end, I filled
    up everything on my Filler notebook.</p>

<p>By the end of the semester in my 2nd year
    of college, it took me 2 filler notebooks.
    I had written many Hiragana characters
    by the end of it.
    It was truly a fun journey,
    and I will always remember it.</p>
